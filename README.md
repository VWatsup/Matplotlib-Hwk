Some trends that we can see on this data, Urban areas contain most of the drivers yet Suburban and Rural areas combined produce half as many rides and fares as the Urban cities.
It is great to see Urban, Suburban and Rural areas use ride sharing.  It helps reduce pollution simply by reducing the number of vehicles on the road.  This can also translates to safer traffic due to less traffic on the road.
